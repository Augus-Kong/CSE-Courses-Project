Average node degree: 2.138
Diameter of the graph: 4 
Average path length: 2.93

Average node degree: this shows the number of direct onnections one node has to other nodes.
Diameter of the graph maybe means the largest distance of all pairs of nodes, it can show us the maximum number of connectiongs required to traverse the graph.
Average path length means the average distance of all pairs of nodes. I think this metrics can show the intimacy of the groups of the people, the smaller the number is, the shorter distance the nodes are.
